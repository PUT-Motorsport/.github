# Welcome to PUT Motorsport 
We are a Formula Student-class racing team based at Poznan University of Technology. 
The Team was founded in 2014. Since the beginning of our activity, we have constructed 7 cars(five combustion and two electric ones), that have achieved
numerous successes in international competitions. Currently we are working on our third electric vehicle - PM08.
## In our repositories you can find all of electronic and software projects done in the electric era
