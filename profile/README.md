# Welcome to PUT Motorsport

We are a Formula Student racing team based at Poznan University of Technology.

The team was founded in 2014. Since the beginning of our activity, we have constructed seven racing cars — five combustion and two electric ones — that have earned numerous achievements in international competitions.

Currently, we are working on two electric vehicles: PM08, being our first driverless design and PM09, featuring four-wheel drive powertrain.
